## 📚 Project Overview

In modern networks, identifying potential failures before they occur can save significant downtime and operational costs. This project aims to provide an AI-driven solution for predicting network failures using various signal metrics and performance indicators. By automating this process, network operators can ensure continuous network operation and optimize maintenance scheduling.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding network-related categorical data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of important features like a 'Failure' flag based on signal strength (dBm) and latency (ms).
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implementation of a Random Forest classifier to predict network failures.
- **Backend API**: Flask-based API that facilitates real-time data analysis and prediction, enabling integration with external applications or dashboards.
