# AI-Driven-Network-Failure-Prediction
This project utilizes machine learning to predict network failures based on real-time signal metrics and network performance data. The goal is to identify potential failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance and reduced downtime. By analyzing key factors such as signal strength (dBm), latency (ms), and network type.
